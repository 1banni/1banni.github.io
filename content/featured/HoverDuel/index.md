Hover Duel is a 2-player battle game set in space where you launch bouncing projectiles at your opponent's hovercraft to destroy it. The map has multiple levels/floors and the game evolves through a series of rounds. Players can pick up health and ammo, drive across aerial bridges between platforms, and utilize PacMan-style map edge entry/exit points.
